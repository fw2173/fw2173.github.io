                <h1>Common Exercises</h1>
                <p>Here are some common exercises that we recommend our members do so they can be successful in life.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Burpee</dt>
                    <dd>Burpees are a great full body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.</dd>

                    <dt>Plank</dt>
                    <dd>Our client The Rock loves these. All you have to do is find various 2x4 wood planks and break them. Super simple.</dd>

                    <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
                    <dd>When she's not busy being the greatest tennis player alive, our client Serena Williams loves this exercise. To start, use google maps to find your nearest mountain. Travel to that location. Once there, climb said mountain. Super simple.</dd>
